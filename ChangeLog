* 2017-10-20: Version 0.1.4
 *  '-i' option of stubby no longer tries to bind to the listen addresses so
    it can be run without requiring root privileges. Makes it easier to validate
    the configuration file syntax. 
 *  Fix incorrect IP addresses for some servers in the config file. Add note that
    IPv6 addresses ending in :: are not supported (must use ::0). Also add 
    example of using a specific port in a listen address.
 *  Fixes for Windows support
